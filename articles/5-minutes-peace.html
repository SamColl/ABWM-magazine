       If you already know, then congratulations: You are oﬃcially part
       of that elite group of people that spends too much time on the
       Internet. If you don’t, don’t worry about it; it must be nice to still
       have productivity in your life.<br><br>
       In case you happen to be one of the curious, the above is a
       meme. In a nutshell, memes are the inside jokes of the Internet.
       They can take many forms, such as phrases, images, websites,
       and videos. The only common factor that unites them all is that
       they are spread via the Internet.<br><br>
       For the more intellectually inclined, the word meme was
       coined by Richard Dawkins in the “The Selﬁsh Gene”. According to Dawkins, a meme is a concept that could be spread from
       person to person or group of people in a manner analogous
       to the process of evolution. Just as species rise and fall according to natural selection, memes can evolve via mutation and
       competition. A perfect example of this evolution can be found
       in the “Y u no guy” meme. The meme features a distinctive face
       of frustration that usually accompanies a question written in
       shorthand that draws attention to a particular issue.<br><br>

    <h2>Breakfast Bites</h2>
    <div class="recipe">
      <h2 class="recipe-header">Parmesan Spinach Muﬃns (for 8)</h2>
      <p class=“article-text”>
400g fresh baby spinach, washed<br>
½ cup ricotta cheese<br>
½ cup ﬁnely shredded Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish<br>
2 large eggs, beaten<br>
1 clove garlic, minced<br>
¼ tsp salt<br>
¼ tsp freshly ground pepper<br>
Preheat oven to 400°F. Pulse spinach in three batches in a food
processor until ﬁnely chopped. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add
all ingredients and stir to combine. Coat 8 cups of a muﬃn pan
with cooking spray. Divide the spinach mixture among the 8
cups (they will be very full). Bake the spinach cakes until set,
about 20 minutes. Let stand in the pan for 5 mins. Loosen the
edges with a knife and turn out onto a clean cutting board or
large plate. Serve warm, sprinkled with more Parmesan.</p>

1½ cups chopped zucchini<br>
¼ cup thinly sliced fresh basil<br>
1 cup fresh mozzarella balls<br>

Sauté onion and zucchini in oil in a heavy based pan, and cook,
stirring frequently until soft, 3 to 5 mins. Whisk eggs, salt and
pepper in a bowl. Pour the eggs over the vegetables in the
pan. Cook, lifting the edges to allow uncooked egg from the
middle to ﬂow underneath, until nearly set, about 2 minutes.
Arrange mozzarella and sun-dried tomatoes on top and place
the pan under a grill until the eggs are slightly browned, 1½
to 2 minutes. Let stand for 3 minutes. Top with basil. To release
the frittata from the pan, run a spatula around the edge, then
underneath, until you can slide or lift it out onto a cutting board
or serving plate. Cut into 4 slices and serve.</p>
