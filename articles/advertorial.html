         <p class="article-text" id="advertorial-para1">
          The Alice Smith School is constantly evolving and always conscious
          of its mission for delivering excellence in British education through
           a holistic approach to education. The development of each child’s
           character and personality, their emotional intelligence and “grit”
           is essential to their academic achievement and given significant
           attention.<br><br>

           An Alice Smith education supports mastery of subject matter, liberated
            by independent thought and brought to life through self-confidence,
            collaboration and creative thinking. It is a challenging academic
            curriculum enriched with character development designed to help
            young people flourish academically and personally.</P><br><br>

            <h2 class="article-text-header">Inspiring a Love of Learning Through
              Collaborative Teaching</H2><br><BR>
            <p class="article-text">  Teaching and learning methods are evolving, with group projects,
                peer-to-peer learning and blended and interactive approaches common.
                Learning spaces are designed to be flexible and versatile with
                 mobile and adaptable furniture, encouraging and enabling
                 collaboration, communication and teamwork.<br><br>
                 The school environment is rich in technology with easy access to
                 the internet, digital resources and social media. Alice Smith
                 utilises the power of Google Suite for Education across both
                 Windows and Mac platforms to provide tailored learning opportunities
               for our students.<br><br>

               Classrooms and their surrounding areas support teachers moving among
               students to provide real-time feedback and direction, and to support
               peer-to-peer learning, adapt to pedagogies and learning preferences
               and create an active and engaging experience for learners and teachers.
               <br><br>
               Curiosity is encouraged to help students make meaningful connections.
                Producing and asking questions allows students to think divergently
                and critically about what they are learning - in many different
                 directions. Students learn to ask better questions and are able
                 to recognise the importance of the process of problem solving.</p><br><br>

              <h2 class="article-text-header">An Innovative Approach to Learning
                Fosters Development of Essential Skills</h2>
                <p class="article-text"> The essential skills of critical thinking
                  (finding solutions to problems), creativity (thinking outside
                  the box), collaboration (working with others) and communication
                   (talking to others) are central to learning and teaching, along
                   with information literacy (understanding facts, figures,
                   statistics and data), media (understanding the methods and
                   outlets in which information is published) and technology.<br><br>

                Life skills such as flexibility, leadership, initiative, productivity
                and relationship building are developed alongside character education
                for resiliency and perseverance, self-discipline and diligence as
                 well as integrity, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and
                 good citizenship.</p><br><br>

                 <p class="article-text"> We are committed to the professional growth of our teachers. A
                 coaching programme for growing the social and professional capital
                  of our teachers supports the development of relationships grounded
                  in trust, reflection, self-directed goals and collaboration,
                  enhancing collegiality and resilience and cohesion in our school
                   community.<br><br>

                   Building a coaching philosophy across our school has led to
                   further innovation in the classroom and pastorally, particularly
                   in the areas of assessment, feedback, restorative conversations
                   and greater cohesion in our school community.</p><br><br>

              <p class="article-text">Personal reflection and identification of areas of strength and for
               development are fundamental to professional growth. Alice Smith
               teachers learn in peer partnerships, sharing professional readings,
                discussions based on action research, they participate in peer
                observations and collaboratively plan, teach and reflect upon lessons.</p><br><br>

                    has a significant impact on student achievement and restores
