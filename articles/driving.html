        Being in possession of a UK driving license valid until I am 70, I did
        not ever think I would have to take another driving test. <br><br>However, due
        to changes in requirements in both UK and Malaysia, the current situation
         dictates that British citizens now need a Malaysian license to drive here.
          It is no longer possible to swap your UK license for a Malaysian one.
          So you have to take the Malaysian driving test.<br><br>
      The process covers several sections.  So, where to start?<br><br>
      Luckily I had the contact for a wonderful instructor who only teaches foreigners
       here.  Anna Goh.  Anna is so helpful in explaining the stages and how to
       go about them.  First off comes the theory test which is a multiple choice
       online exercise in English.  It is held at several different centres throughout
       the Klang Valley and you can choose the one you prefer.  A specification is
       that you need to wear a collared, sleeved T shirt, long trousers and covered
        shoes.  People have been turned away if this requirement is not met!<br><br>
      The next stage is the actual lessons.  We attended the Safely Driving Centre
      in PJ where Anna is based.  The administration offices are here as well as
      the driving circuit for the off-road section of the test.<br><br>
      The circuit test comprises a verbal explanation of the basic workings of
      the car.  This has to be word perfect using Malaysian English descriptors,
      so can be a bit testing initially!  There then follows a tour of the circuit
      driving yourself on a set route which covers a ramp test, a slope test,
      parallel parking, a 3 point turn, a set of S bends and a Z bend.  Once again
       specific steps must be demonstrated to the examiners around the course.<br><br>
      Part 2 is the road test which covers a verbal brief of the steps required
      to start the car.   Again, needing to use the specific terminology which
      the examiners require.  Then comes a drive with the examiner out onto the
      PJ roads.<br><br>
      Both circuit and road test are carried out on the same day and you receive
      immediate notification of pass or fail.  It is possible to pass one part
      and fail the other.  In which case, you only re-take the section you fail.<br><br>
      Anna teaches you how to pass the test, not how to drive of course as you
      know that already!  It’s not an easy process, especially when you’ve been
      driving for well over 40 years anyway.  But needs must and Anna is the one
      to lead you through it so ably.<br><br>
      Her details are:  Anna Goh on +6012 388 7145….and mention my name.
      Good luck!<br><br>
      PS  As of today, I am still waiting for my test date to come through!
