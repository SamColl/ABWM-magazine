         <p class="article-text">Debbie Ocean, sister of the late Danny, has been hatching an almighty
           heist whilst serving a prison sentence. On release, she gets the ‘old’
            team together, amongst them a phenomenal pick pocket, a costume
            jeweler and a deluded almost bankrupt designer. She sets into motion
            her plan to steal a 150 million dollar Cartier necklace.
            An elaborate party sees eight extremely talented ladies with a plan
            so good, it includes a substitute necklace being made in the time it
            takes a model to be sick! They have managed to orchestrate their movements
            to avoid detection by the security cameras, staff on the job on the inside,
            and time to make the initial loss of the necklace look like an accident,
            when they find it in a fountain. It’s as if the sick model had dropped it there by accident!
            Genius plan, great film and cast and a story that follows the plots of the Ocean 7 series!
