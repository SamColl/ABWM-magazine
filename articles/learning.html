      “Everyone has strengths. For many, Literacy or Numeracy is not one of them.
      This does not mean that the person has to be labelled as being learning
      disabled. Just like other weaknesses improve with consistent intensive
       practice, so do Literacy and Numeracy skills. The reality is that people,
        with a learning difficulty, suffer throughout their formative years but
        it is important to understand that it is not as a result of the learning
        difficulty. On the contrary, it is a result of low expectations, being
        regarded as incapable and victimized by being called demeaning names.”<br>
        [An adult with Auditory Processing Disorder]

    </div>
    <p class="article-text">1 in 5 children has a learning difficulty. That means
      in an average class of 20, 4 students struggle with accessing the curriculum.
       The signs are evident from an early stage. However, many teachers will put
       it down to developmental milestones and will not think that it warrants
        further investigation. Research, however, shows that early intervention
         is the most effective for overcoming any learning issues. If it isn't
         addressed in the early years, it starts to impact basic literacy skills
         like reading and spelling resulting in there being a gap in the student’s
         reading ability.</p> <br><br>
         <blockquote id="learning">
           “After we moved here and he started in Year 4, Nabil was not progressing
           as well as we thought he could. He just about managed to meet his targets
           toward the end of the year but it had been a struggle. He had an aversion
            to books because he was not able to read age-appropriate books without
             asking for help. His spellings were touch and go. Being a sporty child
             and thanks to all the sports facilities, he didn’t dislike school
             completely but he certainly wasn’t the happiest kid going in. We
             put it down to being in a new environment, a new school and generally
             a settling-in period, especially since the Class Teacher had not
             raised any concerns.”</blockquote> <br><br>

          <p class="article-text">
           Many times teachers tend not to raise issues about a child’s progress
           unless their attainment level is well below the expected target. Even
           then, only those who have some knowledge of Learning Difficulties will
           highlight their concerns to parents or to the Learning Support Unit,
           if there is one. In the meantime, the student tries to manage the
           learning but, with little support and no one really addressing an issue,
           gradually becomes discouraged and starts losing confidence in his or her
           abilities. </p> <br><br>
           <blockquote id="learning">
             “As the year progressed, Jessica became quiet and serious which was
             the opposite of her extrovert nature. In the Parent-Teacher meetings,
              her class teacher did not seem very concerned and did not think there
               was any major issue. Jessica was said to have a positive attitude,
                although she would not participate much in class discussions and
                would sometimes go into her own world. These were the points the
                teacher raised. She suggested that Jessica focuses more in the
                lesson and takes part in discussions more often. Those were her
                 targets moving forward…” </blockquote><br><br>

          <p class="article-text">
As the student moves on, with no accommodations or support, the demands of the
curriculum go up and academics start becoming a big challenge. The student becomes
restless and fidgety which translates into “A.D.D”.  Some may go further and become
aggressive or become victims of bullying. Some may become rebellious, especially
at home, and begin to show a lack of interest in their work. The response may be
to place them in ‘lower abilities’ class, if there is one, or refer them to
counseling. </p> <br><br>

  <blockquote id="learning">
    “Moving into Year 5, after a lovely break, we hoped that Nabil would be more
    settled knowing the system and having made friends. Unfortunately, that was not
    the case. By the end of first term, Nabil was not making much progress (though
     he was not failing) and he became angry and frustrated.  He started seeing
      the school counselor once a week. I discussed his behaviour and progress
       with the teacher and she referred us to Learning Support. However, he did
       not get the support he needed because they felt that he was managing
       academically and was not severe enough. Plus he was getting counseling
       support for his emotional issues. My gut feeling was that there was something
       more and he had to be assessed.” </blockquote><br><br>

       <p class="article-text">
         Parents may not know or realise that when students are labelled or thought
          of as being unable to perform academically, the accommodations would result
          in them being placed at a level where they learn the very basic skills in
           the subjects. From that point of view, the student would not ‘fail’.
           (It is mainly those students who fail at this basic level that get
            support and intervention) If they continue to meet the basic skills level,
             they remain ‘under the radar’ and plod along. An involved parent would
             be able to see the basic level of work the child is doing and then make
              a call on what needs to be done. In addition, there is a lot more group
               work done during lessons so very often, the more able students tend to
               do most of the research and writing while the students with LS needs,
               may help with the presentation or doing unimportant tasks like making
               a video. Credit would go to the group as a whole. </p> <br><br>

               <blockquote id="learning">
                 “I was not comfortable seeing the change in my daughter’s personality.
                She was clearly unhappy and finding lessons difficult. I know she’s
                very capable and has strengths. So I decided to go ahead and have
                Jessica assessed, back home, over the winter holidays. She was
                diagnosed with mild dyslexia. For the three weeks that we were
                on holiday, she worked with a Remedial Therapist everyday for an
               hour. I was not sure if there would be anyone like that available here.
               The little she got over the holidays restored some of her confidence.”</blockquote>
               <br><br>
            <p class="article-text">An Educational Assessment (by a Learning Support
              Specialist) or a Psychometric Evaluation (by an Educational Psychologist) gives a profile of the student’s strengths and weaknesses in learning, and a diagnosis of the learning difficulty. Recommendations are given for in-class support and any additional support that may be needed. Both assessments serve as a baseline to make Individual Education Plans and provide the right intervention so that any gaps in skills are minimized in the shortest period of time. A Learning Support Specialist would work one on one to develop learning skills.</P>
<br><br>
        <blockquote id="learning">
          “After advertising a lot and asking around, I managed to source a Learning
          Support Specialist who started supporting Nabil once a week. He has been
          getting 1:1 support, outside of school, for approximately 7 months (excluding the summer holidays) and is doing well now. The Educational Psychologist, who assessed Nabil also explained to us how he learns  and the Learning Support teacher showed us ways in which he could be supported at home. He has almost caught up with his reading skills and is happier going to school. It has taken awareness, a diagnosis and the right intervention to restore the capabilities and confidence in my child.  I’ve finally got my boy back - the gentle, polite sportsman with
          the added benefit of becoming a keen and enthusiastic learner. “</blockquote>

      <p class="article-text">A learning difficulty is not a disability. It begins
        to seem like one, however, if the person does not get timely and appropriate
        assistance. On the other hand, if the person is fortunate to get remediation,
        then the learning difficulty would not be a  profound hindrance in developing
        Literacy and Numeracy skills. More important is the impact that the former
         has on the emotional and social wellbeing of the person. It can be devastating
         in the long run and is known to be a common cause of school dropouts and
         juvenile delinquency. The signs of learning difficulty are evident from a
         very early age. Training Early Year  teachers especially will help in
          identifying the difficulty and making accommodations at that stage,
           making it easier to overcome the difficulty. One of the most effective
           support systems is home support. Involving parents and  giving them
           effective resources to support their child helps overcome gaps in a
            shorter period of time. <br><br>
