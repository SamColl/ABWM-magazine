    <div class="article-text1"><strong>Tortelli are super-sized tortellini, which we learned how to make, with varying degrees of success.
We were perhaps better at eating them, along with salads, bruschetta and dessert, not to mention a glass of wine.</strong><br><br>

Michelangelo’s is an authentic Italian restaurant in Solaris Mont Kiara, which is just down the road from Publika.
 It was suggested as a venue for a Pasta Workshop after a successful series of workshops they ran for Gardens
 International School. Thank you Ying (Hacker’s mum) for the introduction! <br><br>

After a lemon tea boost, we gathered around a “Salmon and Crab” table or a “Spinach and Ricotta” table to
use shiny pasta machines to roll out the pre-prepared dough into successively thinner and thinner layers.
More than one person let on that they actually owned one of these machines, but had only used it once
after receiving it as a wedding present. There are pasta machines in the back of cupboards that have
been shipped to multiple locations around the world and have enough air miles to qualify for their own
gold card.<br><br>

A rolling zigzag cutter gave the pretty scalloped edge, and then the tricky bit. Folding the squares
into triangles around the filling and then somehow making them look professional! Harder than
it looks. (See the photos of the Good, the Bad and the Aesthetically Challenged.)<br><br>

After being served a restorative glass of wine, we ate the fruits of our labours, which were delicious.
Michelangelo’s were extremely well-organised and the staff were refreshingly efficient. Many thanks
 to chef Massimo (usually to be found at their Pavilion branch), sous chef Mark and manager Darshan,
as well as to Dilys Chaim who made it all possible. Thanks also to Asian Tigers for providing our raffle
wine, which was won by Bethan Cole.<br><br>

There were many compliments made about the event, and we had a waiting list. If we run another
of these workshops in the autumn, I recommend you come along, as it was a good laugh and a fun lunch.<br><br>
