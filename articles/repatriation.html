        On the 30th of January ABWM hosted an interesting and thoughtful discussion
         by Tricia Carter, a Cultural Intelligence Facilitator, on Global transitions;
          Relocation and Repatriation. The talk centered around the difficulties people
           face moving to a new place, especially one which is far from home and
           different in so many aspects to what one is used to and, conversely,
           when one moves back to their country of origin after having lived abroad
           for many years. In a wonderfully intimate and informal setting, members
            shared with Tricia some of their experiences with having to move to new
            places and also when they've gone back home for holidays. Cultural
            differences, language differences, simple things like weather and would
             it melt our candles were some of the topics that were touched on.</p><br><br>

          <p class="article-text">Relocating can be a momentous change which affects the whole family.
          Tricia touched on ways to ease that transition. The physical move,
          sometimes going more smoothly than the mental and emotional one. If it
          is a first time transfer to a different part of the world your reactions
          may be different to a new culture and environment than if you were a
          more seasoned mover. One's openness to such differences will also depend
          on one's individual personalities. For spouses, who may have had their
          own careers and financial independence and who now cannot work, a move
          can often lead to a loss of identity and a need to find their new role
          in the family dynamics.</p><br><br>

          <p class="article-text">Tricia spoke of 5 ways to well-being
            to help with such a transition.</p><br><br>

          <ol class="repat-list">
          <li>Be active. Do something! Join a local gym, a book club or indulge in a
           hobby you love.</li>
          <li>Take notice. Where we are in the moment.</li>
          <li>Connect. Our connection with people affects our mental well being.</li>
          <li>Keep learning. Take advantage of the concept of the university of the
             3rd age.</li>
          <li>Give of your time. Even if it's volunteering in your child's school
            or a local NGO.</li>
          </ol>
            <br><br>
            <div class="mobile-advert">
              <img src="../images/Silver_mobile.jpg">
            </div>
            <p class="article-text">Children are also affected by the changes to
               their environment and can find the transition quite hard. One of
                the ideaâ€™s put forth by Tricia to help facilitate the change was
                to create an identity as a family, one which is not based on
                 geographical location. Whether it is simply a weekly movie night
                 at home for the whole family or playing board games. Taking out
                  an atlas, helping your child locate your new destination was
                  another suggestion. Searching up information together so they
                  feel more prepared and discussing the different cultures and
                   languages they may encounter would also help them understand
                   the differences they may encounter.<br><br>

                   Whilst relocation has been given much thought with companies
                    offering relocation services to help with home rentals, schools
                     and general knowledge of the country they are moving to, not
                     much thought has been given to repatriation. Companies do not
                     offer repatriation facilities to families who are returning home
                     due to their overseas contract ending or most often simply
                     because the working member of the family has retired and faces
                     the reality of going back to what was once considered home.
                      Repatriation is sometimes as difficult as Relocation.  One
                      of the challenges of going home is the cost of the growth
                      you've experienced living in different countries and different
                      cultures. After the challenges and changes of new places it's
                       not always easy going home and settling down. Often, as some
                       members pointed out in the course of the discussion, people
                       back home haven't changed but you have.
                       Leaving a place you have made friends, built a life full of
                       memories can also be quite difficult. Some members attending
                       the talk mentioned how they begin to distance themselves as
                        a coping mechanism.

                <p class="article-text">Tricia mentioned an interesting method to help with such transitions,
                called building a RAFT.<br><br> A RAFT of Reconciliation, Affirmation,
                Farewell and Think Destination. <br><br>
                <strong>Reconciliation</strong> - Where one lets
                go of unresolved issues and mends any bridges they feel they need to.
                 It is only with proper closure of issues that one can move on without
                 carrying mental baggage of unresolved problems.<br><br>
                 <strong>Affirmation</strong> - of what you had in the place you have been staying
                 and what it means to you. Acknowledging friends and their impact
                 on you. Children are also affected by having to leave their friends,
                  their schools, help them in acknowledging those relationships.
                   Notes of appreciation go a long way.  <br><br><strong>Farewells</strong> - this is not
                   just reserved for people. It can also mean to places which hold
                   special memories. Farewell mementos help in the process of leaving.
                    <br><br><strong>Think Destination</strong> - this is where you and your family think of
                    where you are going. For those going home, think of what changes
                     have taken place within you and those that have, or have not,
                      taken place at home. An interesting concept which allows you
                      to move on in peace and face the challenges that are ahead
                      of you.<br><br>
