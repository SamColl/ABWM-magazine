                  Four students from the Australian International School Malaysia
                  (AISM) were awarded ‘Gold Tickets’ to compete in the World
                  Mathematics Championships in Melbourne later this year. This was
                  the result of their outstanding achievements at the South East
                  Asian (SEA) Mathematics Competition held in the city of Ho Chi
                  Minh. In addition, the students, together with another 5 students,
                   collectively brought home eight medals from the competition.
                   <br><br>

                   This is the second time AISM has attended this competition,
                   competing with 165 students from schools across South East Asia.
                    The competition consisted of nine different events over the two
                     days and the tasks were both diverse and challenging. There
                     were individual tasks, group tasks with team-mates from AISM
                     and group tasks with students from other schools. Students
                     were expected to display a range of Mathematics skills such
                     as communication, collaboration, challenge, strategy, creativity
                     and knowledge.
                     <br><br>
                     “This was a wonderful experience for our students and they
                     were great ambassadors for the school”, said Michael Lewthewaithe,
                      Head of Mathematics at the School. It was a particularly a proud
                      moment when students Kah Yin Ip, Kian Mun Lam, Megan Yap and Yeu
                       Joe Cheun received their ‘golden tickets’ as an invitation to
                        compete in the world championships held in Melbourne, Australia.
                        <br><br>
                        The opportunity to meet exceptional mathematicians from
                        other schools and cultures was well received and added breadth
                         to the experience for our students. AISM prides itself in
                         providing strong foundations in Science, Technology,
                         Engineering and Mathematics to best prepare our students for
                         the their futures.
