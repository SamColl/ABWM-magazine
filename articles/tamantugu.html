      <h1 class="title">A New Walk in the Woods</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle" id="subtitle-walk-in-the-woods">Following the success of
        our outing to the footpaths of Bukit Kiara, we ventured forth to a beautiful
        new woodland park, which has recently opened. Phase l & ll are complete and
        the remaining larger Phase lll is scheduled to open soon.</h2>

<p class="article-text" id="wood-walk-text">
  Taman Tugu (Taman = Park or garden, Tugu = Monument) is located right in the middle
  of town, close to Merdeka Square. It is a great place to take your visitors for a
  little taste of jungle, without having to drive or walk miles or meet any leeches.
  Part of the route is pretty level and suitable for aged parents and the rest is well
   maintained with stone steps and footways. It gets very slightly muddy after rain,
   but is generally well drained.</p><br><br>

 </div>
<p class="article-text">We set off at 8:30am, and we were the only ones in the car park apart from a catatonic
security guard! The paths are almost completely in the shade, but it can be humid unless there is a breeze blowing. We wore mosquito repellent, but there is no need to smother yourself in sunscreen. <br><br>
I have been to the park at the weekend and even then there were only a few visitors.
This may change when the new visitors centre opens with Phase lll, but go there now
while it’s quiet. There are several areas with adult sized swings to soothe you and
a great little photo spot with a view of the Twin Towers surrounded by foliage.
There is running clean water in a pretty little stream and signage and maps.
Sadly, dogs are not allowed.</p><br>

<h2 class="article-text-header">About Taman Tugu</h2>
<p class="article-text" id="wood-walk-text">There are currently 40 acres with about 4km of forest trails
  open daily to the public from 7am to 6.30pm with free admission.
By early 2020, they will be opening more trails and will have a total of
approximately 7km of walking available.</p><br>


<h2 class="article-text-header">History</h2><img src="../images/article-images/walkwoodstree.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"id="woods-walk-img-tree">

<p class="article-text" id="wood-walk-text">Originally, the area was home to British residences, prior
  to independence in 1957. There are quite a number of palm oil trees, which are
  believed to have been brought in as seeds from West Africa and planted for
  ornamental purposes. After independence, the site was then home to Malaysian
  government officials including the first Lord President, the first Director
  of Agriculture and Finance Minister Tun Tan Siew Sin. The area eventually was
  home to government quarters and you will see the footprints of these quarters
  as concrete slabs along the trails.</p><br><br>

<h2 class="article-text-header">Phew!</h2>

<p class="article-text" id="wood-walk-text">The land was being proposed as a site for a for-profit
  theme park or for commercial development, but fortunately, the Malaysian sovereign
   wealth fund Khazanah were persuaded to convert the land into a public park and
   protect the secondary forest. In conjunction with FRIM (the Forest Research
    Institute of Malaysia) existing trees have been protected and 4,000 new trees
    have been planted. Over 100 truckloads of rubbish were cleared from the site.</p>
    <img src="../images/article-images/walkwoodstowers.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"id="woods-walk-img-towers"><br><br>
<h2 class="article-text-header">Inspired by our National Trust</h2>
<p class="article-text" id="wood-walk-text">Taman Tugu will be transferred into Amanah Warisan Negara
   (“AWAN”) to be managed and protected into perpetuity as a public green space.
   AWAN is a national public trust incorporated with a longer term objective to
   undertake more projects that involve the rejuvenation, rehabilitation and/or
   operations of selected public spaces together with heritage assets of national
    significance – as inspired by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest
     or Natural Beauty or commonly known as the National Trust UK.</p><br><br>

<h2 class="article-text-header">How to get there</h2>
<p class="article-text" id="wood-walk-text">We met at the Campsite car park, which is E2 on the attached
  map. It’s a gravel area beside the road, by the funky industrial style concrete gateway. There are two other entrances, but this is the best for level access.
The car park is on Persiaran Sultan Salahuddin, between the National Monument (Tugu
Negara) and the Istana Selangor (Sultan of Selangor's KL Palace) The road is a small
winding lane which goes past all the parked coaches at the National Monument and up
the hill, past the Taman Tugu Nursery car park, and Gate E1, on to the car park beside
 the road.</p>
