<p class="article-text">I am Annie and a member of the ABWM Charity Coordinator Team.
  I had heard the name TANMA being mentioned many times in different circles, and
   they were at our ABWM Christmas Bazaar selling their handmade wares as well. I
   didn’t know much else about this Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) apart from
   the fact that they helped the Burmese refugee community. So, when Julie, our
   ABWM Committee Chair, forwarded to us TANMA’s Open House International Women’s
   Day flyer, I saw a chance to learn more about this quite famous NGO.
The Open House was held in a bright function room. Audrey Perriolat, the current
volunteer coordinator of the TANMA Federation, greeted me upon my arrival and told
me the story of TANMA. I also took the opportunity to talk to the Burmese women
 and vendors on site, most of which work with the TANMA women’s sewing expertise
  in order to manufacture their own merchandise.

  <p class="article-text">Refugees settling in Malaysia are often not recognized by the country
  and therefore cannot benefit from the social services such as health care,
  joining the local workforce and education. Out of this need to sustain themselves
  and their family and to provide education to their children, different organisations
   were created to support the different communities and their specific needs.
   Sometimes, different organisations would collaborate with each other to make
   a central organisation in order to share resources and knowledge that could
    bring about more benefit to their combined communities. One such organisation
    was TANMA.</p>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <h2 class=tanma-heading>TANMA Federation: Refugee Women Fair Trade</h2>

      <p class="article-text"  id="tanma-refugee-text">
      TANMA, meaning “strong” in Burmese, operates under Tenaganita (Women’s Force),
      the local NGO powerhouse that’s been active since 1991 for the protection and
      promotion of the rights of women, migrants and refugees. Founded in September
      2010 by the women of Mangtha (“sweet dreams” in Burmese), Kaoprise and Chin
       Women Organisation (CWO), which were three ethnic Burmese refugee women’s
       group, the TANMA Federation was to be a cooperative for and run by refugee
        women. In addition to sharing resources and expertise, the cooperative also
         provided greater support system in networking and marketing, thus creating
         financial and livelihood opportunities for these women. </p><br><br>

      <p class="article-text">With TANMA, these women do not only learn about
        their rights as women and as workers but also to own and protect these
        rights within their work  environment and also within their family and
         community.
      <br>
      Education being a key factor for self-empowerment, sustainable
      income-generating programs were developed in order to help the betterment
      of these women: <img id="mission-statement"src="../images/mission-statement.png" alt="Mission statement"
      width="350px">


      <ul class="tanma-skills">
<li>Consistent training on livelihood skills</li>
<li>Continuous English language lessons</li>
<li>Business & marketing skills development</li>
<li>Financial literacy training</li>
<li>Livelihoods project management</li>
<li>Leadership development</li>
</ul>
<p class="article-text">Today TANMA regroups five different Burmese organisations
  that represents refugees from different states and each organisation produces
  their own products (cf. map below): Mangtha, CWO, Kaoprise, Paw Ghee and Ing Raw.
   This is no small feat since some of these ethnic groups have a historically tense
   relationship with each other. The collaborative model of TANMA provided these
   different groups to learn from each other and to increase the solidarity between
   them.
All revenues from the sale of their merchandise goes back into their community to
keep their centers and services operating. In addition to producing their own products,
 TANMA also promote the collaboration between entrepreneurs and the women artisans in
  order to produce merchandise that are locally and ethically made.</p><br><br>

      <p>At 13 years old, Muang I came to Kuala Lumpur in 2010 with her family
        from the Chin State. Later on, she enrolled in a school for refugees where
        she learned English and other subjects. Young but with a strong desire to
        help her community, two years ago she took on the daunting task of Operation
         Manager at the Mangtha center. She is quite busy, but happy, in helping
         the center run their six months sewing program and the nursery to help the
         working mothers. They are currently seven artisans at their Pudu workshop,
         producing various handmade accessories using their traditional Chin fabrics
         and designs ranging from eyeglasses holders, aprons, wine wraps to wallets
         and trendy handbags. Most cross-stitching projects are done by their church
         members. Some pieces take 2 days to make while more complicated ones can
         take up to 7 days to complete.

   <p class="article-text"> TANMA is always on the lookout for donations: monetary,
     clothes, school supplies, staple (rice, cooking oil, etc.), hygiene products,
     etc. They also have a need for volunteer teachers in English, Science and Math
     at the Primary level as well as instructors for professional vocations: sewing,
      manicure, massage therapy, to name a few. You can also contribute by buying
      their beautiful handcrafted products… and of course, spread the word around!<p><br><br>
      <h2 class="tanma-heading">Collaborations</h2>
       <p class="article-text">After talking with the vendors onsite, it was clear
         that they really appreciate and enjoy collaborating with these Burmese women.
          In addition to the monetary income that these women gain with each new
           project, they also acquire valuable expertise in working with different
           vendors, quality fabrics and products; an expertise that they can, in
           turn, teach to others in their community.</p>

               when Pauline was introduced to TANMA’s Mangtha ladies in 2018.
                The trust and complicity that was developed from their collaboration
                resulted in a beautiful line of handcrafted baby accessories and
                 kids clothing. As Pauline was very hands-on and meticulous about
                  the sewing, she values the fact that the Mangtha ladies were very
                  receptive and eager about learning the finer sewing details, a
                  knowledge that they could use for other sewing projects and pass
                  on to their peers.</p>

           <p>Born from her love of yoga and a wish to contribute to the community,
             Marjolijn created Surya Bags in 2016. Not too hands on with sewing,
             she was happy to be able to tap into the Malaysia Karen Organisation
              (MKO) Paw Ghee ladies’ sewing knowledge in order to produce the bags
               at their Kuala Lumpur workshop. Originally just producing yoga bags,
               the lineup has expanded to handbags and sport bags as well. Currently
               there is only one MKO lady from the original group that remains sewing
               the bags but she has trained her husband to sew as well. She is now
               also training two other peers of her community.</p>

         <p>Coup de Pouce, meaning “giving a helping hand” in French, was founded
           in 2012 by French volunteers. This NGO’s main goal is to help local
            associations in their needs, TANMA being one of them. In addition to
            regularly organise funding events and donation collections, they also
            have a showroom, hosted at one of the volunteers’ own home, where you
             can go to and buy merchandise: jewelry, clothing, board games, books,
             etc. Should you be interested, do email them to arrange a visit.<br>
             For the occasion, Coup de Pouce was also selling locally and organically
             grown herbal tea to benefit the Positive Living Community, another NGO
              helping marginalised individuals.</p>

       <p>There are a few organisations offering handwoven bags and baskets from

         Julianna Lee, a Malaysian from Kuching, after she witnessed the plight
          of the ethnic women in the Miri region of Sarawak. Today, Penan Bags –
           Europe employs about 30 Penan women and 100% of the proceeds from the
