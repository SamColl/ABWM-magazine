    <p>Caryn Lim of Robinson's department store kindly invited us along to a cooking demonstration
      at their brand new location at Four Seasons Place -  conveniently located right next door to KLCC<br><br>
      On entering the store, the bright airy entrance and the friendly faces of the staff really make you feel welcome. The store is well laid out with plenty of space and each
      department is eye-catching.<br><br>
      Chef Bee Bee hosted the cooking demonstration on behlaf of Kitcen Aid. She showed us how to make a plant based recipe of Seaweed Wraps. Chef Bee Bee explained all of te ingredients and how each one benefits our bodies in a healthy and positive way.
      <br><br>
      The Kitchen Aid equipment was demonstrated to us in easy to follow steps and we were amazed at how simple it was to use the vareity of
      tools that come with the machine and all the beneftis it has to fit into your lifestyle.
      We were amazed at the food presentation techniques and the tips she gave us all to make our food look beautiful. We were all able to have a go at making the food and - of course 0 have a taste at the end of the demonstration.<br><br>
      After the cooking demo, Caryn had arranged for us to have some lunch is Croisserie Artisan Bakery on Level 1. Wow! The food was very fresh and nicely presented and we all enjoyed the spread of wraps,
      tea and coffee laid out for us. We checked out their normal menu and it offers fresh sandwiches, cakes and a variety of teas, coffee and juices too - all at reasonable prices.
      <br><br>Ater lunch we explored the store. It felt very familiar with many well known UK brands and products you don't usually find here in Malaysia.
      Joh Lewis has a big department within the store, offering a huge variety of bedding, pillows and blankets. Moving around the ground floor you can also find a huge selection of sportswear and underwear, with an excellent variety of sizes.
      Clothes departments featured Oasis, Jigsaw, Coast, Kendall & Kyle, John Lewis babywear, Phase Eight, Spanx, Ted Baker and many, many more. <br><br>
      In other words, hours of retail therapy all under one roof! Check it out when you're next the the city.</P>
